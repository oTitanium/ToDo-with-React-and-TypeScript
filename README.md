# ToDo-with-React-and-TypeScript

## Description
This is a To-Do web app for tracking and displaying a list of to-do
items. The useState hooks were used to create and access an array of list
of to-do items and used a map function to iterate through the hook while assigning keys.
Everytime a to-do item is selected, the program shows as Selected and creates a checkmark to
show that it has been done.
